We implemented a version of the classic Pacman game.
This game was developed as a **Singe Page Application** that runs only on one HTML page (html.index) with a few Divs. we used HTML5 canvas, CSS, and Java Script. We used jQuery Plugin to validate the user's input, sign up and sign in. Some features have been added, such as choice of colors, number of monsters, controls keys, pallets quantety, and time limit. 

Additional functionalities added:
1.	**Medicine** – adds one more life.  
2.	**Clock** – adds 25%  of the original time limit to the timer.
